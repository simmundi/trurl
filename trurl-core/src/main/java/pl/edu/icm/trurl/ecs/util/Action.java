 * Action is a single piece of business logic which can be applied to asingle Entity.

 * Actions might require a context, which is an arbitrary object created on a per-chunk basis.
 * Since all entities within a chunk are guqranteed to be processed in a single thread, the
 * context object doesn't need to be thread-safe and its usage is deterministic across execution
 * with different numbers of threads (including the single-threaded execution).
